"""Module storing constants for the Quantum Secret Hitler game.

This module centralizes numeric values so the rest of the code can simply
import ``constants``.  In addition to the deck composition, we fix the total
number of players to 10 and the distribution of liberals and fascists.
The angles used in the voting and policy selection procedures are derived
from the ``DELTA`` parameter described in ``IQU_CODE_FEST_CapitalQ.pdf``.
